Notes from the book RCookBook by Paul Teetor
========================================

I highly suggest this book for anyone wanting or needing to learn R. This, along
with The Art of R Programming are my recommended texts for learning R. Both can
be approached as reference texts or as texts to go through entirely to fully
immerse yourself in the language.
